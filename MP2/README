	START a Node on VM:
		'python3 DataNode.py 01'				// not full name, 01 02...10 is enough

	HOW to use:
		after "Waiting for CMD", you can type:

			- 'JOIN' for node to join the group

			- 'ctrl C' fail/kill

			- 'LEFT' to exit

			- current master node's information will be updated. Please wait a second

				* No master, no file ops

				* If current master failed, a new master will be elected
        

MP2 file ops
			- "put localfilename sdfsfilename"
        
        
			- "get sdfsfilename localfilename"

			- "delete sdfsfilename"

			- "ls sdfsfilename"

			- "store"


TODO:
	DataNodeServer: Receive FileList
				
			(start from handle) 
			May need access to self.file_list in DataNode
			
	DataNode:	0. kill_old_master -> how to kill a thread 
				line:243 terminate
				(May Ignore)
			1. If original PUT/GET doesn't work, feel free to use scp
			2. BACKUP related function need test
			

	MasterNode: 	0. Alive-Node List exists in self.membershipList of DataNode
			(but a real alive membershipList may not be necessary, since DataNode should request for reassign)
			
			1. Where to detect failure node
				a. MyCheckerThread -> ctrl-F "changed from FAIL to REMOVE"
				b. membershipList.remove()
				
				May need an event/access to MasterServer
			
	Log for file ops(in DataNod/MasterServer I guess?)
