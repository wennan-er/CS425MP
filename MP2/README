	START a Node on VM:
		'python3 DataNode.py 01'				// not full name, 01 02...10 is enough

	HOW to use:
		after "Waiting for CMD", you can type:

			- 'JOIN' for node to join the group

			- 'ctrl C' fail/kill

			- 'LEFT' to exit

			- current master node's information will be updated. Please wait a second

				* No master, no file ops

				* If current master failed, a new master will be elected
        

MP2 file ops
			- "put localfilename sdfsfilename"
        
        
			- "get sdfsfilename localfilename"

			- "delete sdfsfilename"

			- "ls sdfsfilename"

			- "store"


TODO:

	Log for file ops(in DataNod/MasterServer I guess?)
